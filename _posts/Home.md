I'm an Assistant Professor in the Department of Convergence Security Engineering at the Sungshin Women's University. 
I received a Ph.D. degree in Mathematical Sciences at Seoul National University(SNU) under the supervision of Prof. Jung Hee Cheon in 2019, and I received a B.S. degree in the Department of Mathematics Education at Korea University in 2013.
I'm leading the Sungshin-Crypto Lab. Our research group studies Lattice-based cryptography, Post-quantum cryptography, Cryptographic protocols, and Privacy-enhancing techniques.
